# Creating a Password Generator Using JavaScript.

#  Description

Using JavaScript to generate a random password and increase my knowledge of JavaScript and programming.

I used several different methods for the project including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

The function of this application is so the user will be able to prompt a password from a user chosen number to create a password:

The Length applied was between 8 and 130 characters using upper and lower case letters and numbers.

The user was able to have a choice of special characters found on [see examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

The application will enable the user input to receive a password that is a desired length with characters, numbers and or symbols.

The user will also be able to copy the password and store it in whatever folder/ file they choose.

The application is media friendly so the user can use it on any mobile, tablet or computer.
